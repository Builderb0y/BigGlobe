# Worldgen

## Biomes

### Overworld

Biomes in the overworld are mostly technical, and serve little purpose other than interfacing with vanilla mechanics which require biomes.
* For example, structure generation is tied to biomes.
* Feature placement on the other hand is normally tied to biomes in vanilla, but this is not the case in Big Globe.

Nevertheless, the full list of overworld biomes is:
* Beach
* Cherry Forest
* Cherry Plains
* Cold Dense Forest
* Cold Light Forest
* Cold Plains
* Cold Wasteland
* Deep Dark
	* Spawns deep underground, below where caves can take you.
	* Be prepared to dig a lot to find it.
* Deep Ocean
* Glacier
* Ocean
* Overgrown Beach
* River
* Shallow Ocean
* Swamp Forest
* Swamp Plains
* Swamp Wasteland
* Temperate Dense Forest
* Temperate Light Forest
* Temperate Plains
* Temperate Wasteland
* The Core
	* Spawns even deeper underground, below the deep dark.
	* Full of molten rock.

### Nether

* Ashen Wastes
	* Full of charred trees.
	* Wither skeletons can spawn here.
* Crimson Forest
* Inferno
	* Basically the basalt deltas, but with a cooler name.
	* Blazes can spawn here.
* Nether Wastes
* Valley Of Souls
	* AKA soul sand valley, but once again, I like cool names.
	* Wither skeletons can spawn here.
* Warped Forest

### End

* Chorus Forest
* End Barrens
* End Mountain
* End Plains
* Overgrown End
* The Void

	* Soul lava pockets can be found in the valley of souls.

# Mechanics

## Hyperspace

* A new dimension that serves as a fast travel mechanic.
* Travel to hyperspace by placing a waypoint and walking into it.
* Inside hyperspace you can see every private waypoint you've placed so far, and every public waypoint placed by anyone else on a multiplayer server.
* Hyperspace has no blocks in it, so you are forced to fly constantly.
	* Fly into a waypoint to travel out of hyperspace.
	* If you find a way to continue flying when you exit hyperspace, please report that as a bug.
* Distance in hyperspace is non-linear.
	* The distance between waypoints in hyperspace is the square root of the distance between those waypoints outside of hyperspace.
	* This means that if you have 2 waypoints 100 blocks apart from each other in the overworld, they'll only be 10 blocks apart in hyperspace.
* Hyperspace (and waypoints in general) look cooler when Satin is installed.
* Hyperspace can be disabled in Big Globe's config file if you find it overpowered.
