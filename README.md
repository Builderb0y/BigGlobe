Instructions for building/compiling: good luck. I have a lot of dependencies that aren't declared in build.gradle, and my source sets are full of symbolic links. In older commits, javac would even NPE while trying to compile my code, but that seems to have been fixed now. At the time, I made it a challenge where anyone who could successfully compile my code would be added to the list below to be showcased as awesome people who know what they're doing. But now that javac no longer NPE's, compiling my code is now less challenging. Nevertheless, these are the cool people who managed to beat all 3 challenges:
