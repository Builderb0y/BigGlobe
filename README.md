Current status: in alpha. I am currently adding support for more mods, and in doing so I am figuring out what areas big globe needs improvement in. Once big globe becomes stable and flexible enough to support the mods I want, then I'll release this on Modrinth.

If you want a compiled copy for testing, DM me about it on Discord Builderb0y#1380.
