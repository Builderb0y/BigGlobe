bug fixes:
	geode spikes can still spawn outside of geodes.
	creating a world with the custom time speed gamerule either doesn't get setup properly, or doesn't sync to clients properly.
		this is a fabric bug.

testing:
	cubic chunks compatibility, whenever that's released.
	compatibility with chunk pre-generator mods.
		"chunky" is the one reported to me, and apparently it either
		uses up a stupid amount of RAM, or has a memory leak.

where I left off:
	column values for cliff frac and cliff bias.

AutoCodec:
	log when extra data is provided that isn't a field of the object being deserialized.
	logging for Field/MethodPredicate?
	better handling of default objects:
		@DefaultGet: gets an object from a field or method.
			field can be of type T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can have a return type of T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can take a DecodeContext<T_Encoded> as a parameter, or nothing as a parameter.
			this could also target a constructor.
	builtin framework for key dispatching.
	add @VerifyNotEmpty.
		just a @Mirror for @VerifySizeRange(min = 0, minInclusive = false).

scripting:
	better syntax for specifying variable block states.
		blockState('minecraft:stairs', 'facing': 'north', 'shape': 'straight', 'half': 'bottom')
	expose arrays.
	break statements.
	scriptable RandomSource?
	WorldColumn as object, expose setPos().
	pre and post update operators.
	increment and decrement as expression.
	postfix increment and decrement.
	compareTo operator <=>

features:
	general:
		advancements for finding things?
		all the todos scattered throughout my code.
	overworld:
		allow flowers to place a Feature for every flower.
		ice spikes.
		log cabin structure?
		trees:
			roots.
				use for mangrove trees.
		cave biomes:
			lush:
				walls:
					glow lichen.
					vines.
			mushroom:
				glowing mushrooms?
					that hang from the ceiling?
		make geode placement faster by only computing noise in a sphere instead of a cube.
		fallen logs.
		dungeons:
			cobwebs on ceiling corners.
			skulls on floor.
			redstone torches on walls.
			chains on ceiling.
			piles of gold?
			occasional "big rooms".
			collapsed rooms?
				blocks in the ceiling (and possibly slightly above it) fall onto the floor.
			Feature that spawns in every room.
				or possibly tag of features.
		underground bubbles:
			slime pit.
			lava lake.
			natural bubble:
				water, grass, foliage, etc.
				some kind of light source.
			deep dark bubble:
				can spawn higher than normal deep dark areas.
			ore jackpot:
				lots of ores everywhere.
		make lilypads renewable?
	nether:
		all biomes.
			including charred forest.
				needs assets from old version.
		bedrock.
		weeping and twisting vines in crimson and warped forests.
		ores.
			nether quartz.
			sulfur.
		nether quartz geodes?
		structures.
		rock layers.
	end:
		jessie wants worley noise for the end.

before release:
	disable dev mixins.
	make sure nothing in test package is used.
	disable BigGlobeItems.TEST_ITEM.
	ensure BigGlobeChunkGenerator.WORLD_SLICES is set to false.

when updating to a new version:
	check how ChunkSection counts are used.
		in particular, see if nonEmptyFluidCount is still returned by hasRandomFluidTicks().
		this usage matters for SectionGenerationContext.recalculateCounts().
