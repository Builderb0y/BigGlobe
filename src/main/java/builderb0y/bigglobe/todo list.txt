bug fixes:
	geode spikes can still spawn outside of geodes.
	creating a world with the custom time speed gamerule either doesn't get setup properly, or doesn't sync to clients properly.
		this is a fabric bug.
	after teleporting to a new world, /bigglobe:locateVoronoi shows suggestions from the old world.
		this is probably a minecraft bug, but I haven't looked at it in a huge amount of detail yet.

testing:
	cubic chunks compatibility, whenever that's released.
	compatibility with chunk pre-generator mods.
		"chunky" is the one reported to me, and apparently it either
		uses up a stupid amount of RAM, or has a memory leak.

where I left off:

changelog:
	* Added balls of string.
	* Fixed flint/sticks/rocks spawning under snow.
	* Fixed rough quartz, budding quartz, quartz buds, and quartz clusters not breaking faster with a pickaxe.
	* Fixed rough quartz dropping amethyst blocks.
	* Increased the amount of caves in the overworld.
	* Buffed spawners in dungeons.

AutoCodec:
	log when extra data is provided that isn't a field of the object being deserialized.
	logging for Field/MethodPredicate?
	better handling of default objects:
		@DefaultGet: gets an object from a field or method.
			field can be of type T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can have a return type of T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can take a DecodeContext<T_Encoded> as a parameter, or nothing as a parameter.
			this could also target a constructor.
	builtin framework for key dispatching.
	VerifyNullable.INSTANCE should override toString().
	investigate imprinters.
		SerializableScriptInputs failed to have a coder created for the imprinter path.

scripting:
	SwitchInsnTree needs to manage its case scopes more manually.
	expose arrays.
	ability to break or continue nested loops.
	scriptable RandomSource?
	scripted structure layouts should be able to construct jigsaw structure pieces.

features:
	general:
		advancements for finding things?
		all the todos scattered throughout my code.
		BlockQueue should not use longs for internal storage, as this won't work with cubic chunks.
		check if slimes can even spawn from spawners, and fix this if they can't.
	overworld:
		make emerald ores spawn at high Y levels instead of low Y levels.
		alternate curvy shape for biome distribution which compensates for distribution of noise.
		dynamic registry for overriders?
		configurable bedrock amount.
		desert fossils.
		fallen logs.
		column values for cliff frac and cliff bias.
		allow flowers to place a Feature for every flower.
		ice spikes.
		glaciers.
		log cabin structure?
		trees:
			roots.
				use for mangrove trees.
		cave biomes:
			lush:
				walls:
					glow lichen.
					vines.
			mushroom:
				glowing mushrooms?
					that hang from the ceiling?
		make geode placement faster by only computing noise in a sphere instead of a cube.
		make underground pocket placement faster by only computing noise in a circle instead of a square.
		dungeons:
			piles of gold?
			occasional "big rooms".
		underground bubbles:
			molten? (match molten caves)
		make lilypads renewable?
	nether:
	end:
		jessie wants worley noise for the end.
			convex.

before release:
	make sure nothing in test package is used.
	disable BigGlobeItems.TEST_ITEM.
	ensure BigGlobeChunkGenerator.WORLD_SLICES is set to false.
	make sure SerializableBlockQueue.DEBUG_ALWAYS_SERIALIZE is set to false.

porting:
	add sniffer_diggable_block tag to include overgrown podzol.
	add hanging signs to WoodPalette.
	check how ChunkSection counts are used.
		in particular, see if nonEmptyFluidCount is still returned by hasRandomFluidTicks().
		this usage matters for SectionGenerationContext.recalculateCounts().
