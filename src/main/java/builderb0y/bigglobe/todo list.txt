bug fixes:
	geode spikes can still spawn outside of geodes.
	creating a world with the custom time speed gamerule either doesn't get setup properly, or doesn't sync to clients properly.
		this is a fabric bug.

testing:
	cubic chunks compatibility, whenever that's released.
	compatibility with chunk pre-generator mods.
		"chunky" is the one reported to me, and apparently it either
		uses up a stupid amount of RAM, or has a memory leak.

where I left off:

changelog:

AutoCodec:
	log when extra data is provided that isn't a field of the object being deserialized.
	logging for Field/MethodPredicate?
	better handling of default objects:
		@DefaultGet: gets an object from a field or method.
			field can be of type T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can have a return type of T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can take a DecodeContext<T_Encoded> as a parameter, or nothing as a parameter.
			this could also target a constructor.
	builtin framework for key dispatching.
	add @VerifyNotEmpty.
		just a @Mirror for @VerifySizeRange(min = 0, minInclusive = false).
	ClassValue for ReifiedType anonymous subclasses.
		use for performance to avoid more than one reflective deserialization of captured type.

scripting:
	SwitchInsnTree needs to manage its case scopes more manually.
	better syntax for specifying variable block states.
		blockState('minecraft:stairs', facing: 'north', shape: 'straight', half: 'bottom')
	expose arrays.
	break statements.
	scriptable RandomSource?
	pre and post update operators.
	increment and decrement as expression.
	postfix increment and decrement.
	compareTo operator <=>

	general:
		advancements for finding things?

		cave biomes:
			lush:
				walls:
					glow lichen.
					vines.
			mushroom:
				glowing mushrooms?

			convex.

before release:
	make sure nothing in test package is used.
	disable BigGlobeItems.TEST_ITEM.
	ensure BigGlobeChunkGenerator.WORLD_SLICES is set to false.

porting:
	add mixin to ServerWorld.<init>() to set the ChunkGenerator seed.
	mixin to StructurePlacementCalculator to add a new field for ChunkGenerator.
	mixin to Biome to re-add getter for downfall for scripts (BiomeEntry).
	replace my double vector for mega trees with joml.
	add sniffer_diggable_block tag to include overgrown podzol.
	check how ChunkSection counts are used.
		in particular, see if nonEmptyFluidCount is still returned by hasRandomFluidTicks().
		this usage matters for SectionGenerationContext.recalculateCounts().
