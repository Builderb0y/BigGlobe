bug fixes:
	geode spikes can still spawn outside of geodes.
	creating a world with the custom time speed gamerule either doesn't get setup properly, or doesn't sync to clients properly.
		this is a fabric bug.

testing:
	cubic chunks compatibility, whenever that's released.
	compatibility with chunk pre-generator mods.
		"chunky" is the one reported to me, and apparently it either
		uses up a stupid amount of RAM, or has a memory leak.

where I left off:

changelog:
	* Added underground pockets in the overworld (water, lava, empty, natural, mushroom, and deep variants) and in the nether (lava and soul lava variants).
	* Script features now have a flag to randomly rotate the feature when placing it.
	* Added column values for vanilla worlds.
	* Structures are now scriptable.

AutoCodec:
	log when extra data is provided that isn't a field of the object being deserialized.
	logging for Field/MethodPredicate?
	better handling of default objects:
		@DefaultGet: gets an object from a field or method.
			field can be of type T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can have a return type of T_Decoded or AutoDecoder<T_Decoded>.
			method can take a DecodeContext<T_Encoded> as a parameter, or nothing as a parameter.
			this could also target a constructor.
	builtin framework for key dispatching.
	VerifyNullable.INSTANCE should override toString().
	investigate imprinters.
		SerializableScriptInputs failed to have a coder created for the imprinter path.

scripting:
	SwitchInsnTree needs to manage its case scopes more manually.
	expose arrays.
	ability to break or continue nested loops.
	scriptable RandomSource?
	pre and post update operators.
	increment and decrement as expression.
	postfix increment and decrement.
	compareTo operator <=>
	add floorInt(), ceilInt(), truncInt(), and long equivalents.

features:
	general:
		advancements for finding things?
		all the todos scattered throughout my code.
		dynamic registries for all the things!
	overworld:
		configurable bedrock amount.
		script for cave width.
		scripted structures:
			well.
			small house.
			campfire.
		desert fossils.
		column values for cliff frac and cliff bias.
		allow flowers to place a Feature for every flower.
		ice spikes.
		glaciers.
		log cabin structure?
		trees:
			roots.
				use for mangrove trees.
		cave biomes:
			lush:
				walls:
					glow lichen.
					vines.
			mushroom:
				glowing mushrooms?
					that hang from the ceiling?
		make geode placement faster by only computing noise in a sphere instead of a cube.
		make underground pocket placement faster by only computing noise in a circle instead of a square.
		fallen logs.
		dungeons:
			cobwebs on ceiling corners.
			skulls on floor.
			redstone torches on walls.
			chains on ceiling.
			piles of gold?
			occasional "big rooms".
			collapsed rooms?
				blocks in the ceiling (and possibly slightly above it) fall onto the floor.
			Feature that spawns in every room.
				or possibly tag of features.
		underground bubbles:
			molten? (match molten caves)
		make lilypads renewable?
		migrate bushes to script template feature.
	nether:
	end:
		jessie wants worley noise for the end.
			convex.

before release:
	make sure nothing in test package is used.
	disable BigGlobeItems.TEST_ITEM.
	ensure BigGlobeChunkGenerator.WORLD_SLICES is set to false.

porting:
	add sniffer_diggable_block tag to include overgrown podzol.
	add hanging signs to WoodBlockSet.
	check how ChunkSection counts are used.
		in particular, see if nonEmptyFluidCount is still returned by hasRandomFluidTicks().
		this usage matters for SectionGenerationContext.recalculateCounts().
