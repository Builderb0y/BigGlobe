/**
manages waypoints visible to a specific player at a specific time.
the waypoints visible to a player can change when waypoints are
added or removed from the server, or when the player changes dimensions.
for example, the player will be able to see all public waypoints,
and all of their own private waypoints while in hyperspace,
but in other dimensions their view of waypoints will be filtered to
not include waypoints that are in a different dimension than them.

this class also keeps track of an "entrance" position.
when the player is in hyperspace, this is the position
of the waypoint they entered hyperspace from.
when the player is in any other dimension, this position is null.
